      <p>
        Hey there! I’m <strong>Vicenzo</strong>—a passionate brazilian full-stack developer who loves
        turning creative ideas into sleek, user-friendly, mindblowing experiences. I want users 
        to experience a feeling of ease, fun and beauty on my projects. Since I was a kid 
        I imagined myself building an app that users would enjoy and spend their time on it. 
        I learned designing and programming, but as I grew into my late teenage years 
        I stopped programming and only went back after realizing this was a true passion of mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a perfectionist and I feel that coding gives me the ability to fix mistakes quickly
        and turn those mistakes into something that works and impressive, which is very satisfying.
        I have a genuine obsession with crafting websites that blend style and functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Whether I’m working on a personal side project or collaborating on a larger team,
        I’m dedicated to writing clean, efficient code that solves real problems.
        In my free time, you can find me exploring new coding frameworks or keeping up
        with the latest web design trends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether I’m diving into a personal side project or collaborating on a larger team, 
        I’m always learning, adapting, and aiming to create digital experiences that stand out.
        Thanks for stopping by—feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or learn more about my work!
